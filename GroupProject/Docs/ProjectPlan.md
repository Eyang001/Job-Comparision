## 1 Introduction

The product is a single-user job offer comparison app to compare a current job to a job offer; if a current job is not specified but at least two job offers are specified, two job offers can be selected for comparison instead. After ranking job offers, the comparison entails displaying, for comparison, job details such as title, company, location, yearly salary adjusted for cost of living, yearly bonus adjusted for cost of living, allowed weekly telework days, leave time, and gym membership allowance.

## 2 Process Description

**Inception**
* Activity description: Start requirements engineering, business modelling, analysis and design; minor amounts of implementation, testing, and deployment may also be addressed in this phase. The inception phase is concerned with establishing and developing an overarching design of the system, dealing with making the business case for the project (such as preliminary project schedule, cost estimate, resources needed, risks, etc.), feasibility, and delimiting project scope. Goes from idea to vision of end-product; tentative architecture, and rough planning. 
* Entrance criteria: Stakeholdersâ€™ definition of app requirements. Overview of how stakeholders would use the app, and its needed functionality.
* Exit criteria: Outputs produced include a vision document, initial use-case model, initial project glossary, initial business case, initial project plan and risk assessment, and optionally one or more prototypes. Evaluation criteria of the inception phase are stakeholder concurrence, requirements understanding, credibility, and depth and breadth of any prototype developed. We will know this phase has been completed satisfactorily when stakeholders agree on scope, definition, cost and schedule estimates; when fidelity of primary use cases shows requirements understanding; when business modelling has credibility and so does the analysis and design; and any prototype developed shows depth and breadth; otherwise the project may be cancelled or considerably rethought. 


**Elaboration**
* Activity description: Perform bulk of requirements engineering, significant business modelling, and analysis and design; some amounts of implementation, testing, and deployment may occur during the elaboration phase. The purpose of the elaboration phase is to analyse the problem domain, establish architectural foundation, eliminate highest risk elements (i.e. address most critical use cases), refine plan of activities and estimates.
* Entrance criteria: Vision for project, initial use-case model, precise requirements including classes and their relationships, initial business case, initial project glossary, and initial project plan and risk assessment. 
* Exit criteria: Outputs produced include an almost complete use-case model, supplementary requirements (including non-functional requirements), software architecture; design model, test cases, executable prototype; revised project plan and risk assessment, preliminary user manual. We will know this phase has been completed satisfactorily when the vision and architecture are stable, when the prototype shows that major risks have been addressed or resolved, when the plan is sufficiently detailed and accurate, when all stakeholders agree that the vision can be achieved with the current plan, when actual resource expenditure versus planned expenditure is acceptable; otherwise the project may be cancelled or considerably rethought. 


**Construction**
* Activity description: Perform bulk of implementation; some business modelling, requirements engineering, analysis and design, testing, and deployment. Shift in focus from intellectual property development to product development. All features will be developed in the construction phase, as well as all features thoroughly tested.
* Entrance criteria: An almost complete use-case model, supplementary requirements (including non-functional requirements), software architecture; design model, test cases, executable prototype; revised project plan and risk assessment, preliminary user manual.
* Exit criteria: Output produced is a product ready to be deployed to users, a beta release. In addition, all use cases will have been realized with traceability information, software product integrated on adequate platforms, complete system test results, finalized user manual; and complete set of artifacts including design, code, and test cases. We will know this phase has been completed satisfactorily when the product is stable and mature enough to be deployed to users, when stakeholders are ready for the transition into the user community, when actual resource expenditures are still acceptable versus planned expenditures; otherwise the project release may be postponed. 


**Transition**
* Activity description: Perform significant testing and deployment; with minimal amounts of business modelling, requirements engineering, analysis and design, and implementation. Focus is on deployment and maintenance of product, which may include training customer service and providing help-line assistance. A new cycle of this project development process may start, repeating the previous phases.
* Entrance criteria: A beta release of product, all use cases realized with traceability information, software product integrated on adequate platforms, complete system test results, finalized user manual; and complete set of artifacts including design, code, and test cases.
* Exit criteria: Project will have been completed, with product in use (no longer in beta). Lessons will have been learned, along with a plan for the next release. We will know this phase has been completed satisfactorily when the user is satisfied, and when actual resource expenditures are still acceptable versus planned expenditures.



## 3 Team

**Team members**
* Arthur Lacey
* Robert Aames
* Valentin Pintea
* Zhaoran Yang

**Roles**
* Project manager: Delegates project tasks, tracks project performance, creates short and long-term plans to meet deadlines, and acts as an intermediary between stakeholders and project developers.
* Designer: Is responsible for creating overall high and low-level design for the project, and design considerations, including assumptions, constraints, system environment; architectural design, including component diagram, deployment diagram; low-level design, including class diagram; and user interface design.
* Frontend developer: Is responsible for implementing visual aspects that users view and interact with in the app (i.e. user interface).
* Backend developer: Is responsible for creating the features and components that are indirectly used by a user through a front-end application (i.e. user interface); creates the core computational logic and logical back-end.
* Test engineer: Is responsible for designing manual and/or automated tests to evaluate the project.
